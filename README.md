# PyCity Schools Analysis
-------------------------------------

## Summary
The analysis of the PyCity Schools dataset provides insights into school performance based on various factors. Notably, Charter schools stand out, performing better than District schools. Charter schools achieve higher math and reading scores (83.47 and 83.90) and an overall passing rate of 90.43%. In contrast, District schools have lower average scores (76.96 in math and 80.97 in reading) and a reduced overall passing rate of 53.67%.

School size is a significant factor. Smaller and medium-sized schools excel, with overall passing rates of 89.88% and 90.62%, respectively, while larger schools lag behind with a 58.29% overall passing rate. This suggests that smaller and medium-sized schools provide a better learning environment for academic success.

When examining grade-level performance, the gap between the best and worst-performing schools becomes evident. Top-performing Charter schools achieve over 90% overall passing rates, with Cabrera High School leading at 91.33%. In contrast, the lowest-performing District schools struggle, with Rodriguez High School having a passing rate of 52.99%.

Moreover, there is a clear connection between per student budget and academic success. Schools with a per student budget below $585 excel, with an overall passing rate of 90.37%. Conversely, schools with budgets in the range of $630 to $645 and $645 to $680 show declining academic performance, with overall passing rates of 81.42% and 53.53%, respectively.

In summary, this analysis highlights that school type and size significantly impact student achievement. Charter and smaller-sized schools are more effective at fostering student success. These findings underscore the need for improvement strategies in District and larger schools to enhance educational outcomes for all students.

## Two Conclusions:

### Effect of Per Student Budget on Academic Performance:

- Schools with a per student budget less than $585 demonstrate higher academic performance. They have an average math score of 83.46, an average reading score of 83.93, and an overall passing rate of 90.37%.
- Schools with a per student budget between $585 and $630 also show reasonable academic performance with an average math score of 81.90, an average reading score of 83.16, and an overall passing rate of 81.42%.
- However, as the per student budget increases, academic performance decreases significantly. Schools with budgets between $630 and $645 have an average math score of 78.52, an average reading score of 81.62, and a lower overall passing rate of 62.86%.
- The lowest academic performance is observed in schools with a per student budget between $645 and $680, with an average math score of 77.00, an average reading score of 81.03, and the lowest overall passing rate at 53.53%.

**Conclusion:** This analysis indicates that schools with lower per student budgets tend to have better academic performance compared to schools with higher budgets.

### School Type and Academic Achievement:

- Charter schools consistently outperform District schools in all spending ranges. Charter schools have an average math score of 83.47, an average reading score of 83.90, and an impressive overall passing rate of 90.43%.
- In contrast, District schools have lower average math scores (76.96) and reading scores (80.97), along with a considerably lower overall passing rate of 53.67%.

**Conclusion:** The data emphasizes that Charter schools maintain higher academic standards regardless of the per student budget, while District schools face challenges in achieving similar levels of academic success.
